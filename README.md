What?
=====

Plog is a super-lightweight dynamic blog engine but still with a decent enough administration interface. 
So no editing plain text files through SSH, no.

It's build aroung Google's App Engine, but can be easily adapted to other storage models and DBs.

Works on Python, doesn't have comments and has an Atom feed. Neat, ain't it?

Story?
=====

I've been using custom made blog engines for ages, just because I was there when the most commonly used 
(*cough cough Wordpress*) were being hacked like it was christmas. Also because I'm usually bored.

This is just the packaging of what I've been using over http://prealfa.com/blog. I might improve it somehow
so it can be useful for people else than me.
