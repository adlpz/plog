{"google":"","tagline":"A simple, lightweight and streamlined Blogging Engine written in Python and designed to run on Google's App Engine.","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"##What?\r\n\r\nPlog is a super-lightweight dynamic blog engine but still with a decent enough administration interface. \r\nSo no editing plain text files through SSH, no. It's designed to be a drop-in solution for having a free little\r\nblog running on Google's budget under the free tier of App Engine, and autoescalate if you become a rockstar, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nSo it's built around Google App Engine's Datastore, but should be easy to port to other storage models and DBs. The framework\r\nis the integrated Webapp, but there's a stand-alone version [here](http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/), so it\r\nshould be trivial to run anywhere else.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n\r\n* Easy configuration through one file. No database set up (yay Datastore!)\r\n* **Markdown syntax**\r\n* Atom feed\r\n* **Code syntax highlightling** (http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/)\r\n* Kick-ass JS admin interface\r\n* **Easy customization through a single [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) template**\r\n* Google-provided account management and security, so I don't have to write safe code.\r\n\r\n**Drawbacks**\r\n\r\n* No comment feature. Just use twitter for feedback!\r\n* Needs a Google Account for authentication.\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\n\r\n* [Pystache](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache), a python implementation of the Mustache templating system.\r\n* [simplejson](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson), a streamlined JSON library for Python.\r\n* [rfc3339](https://bitbucket.org/henry/rfc3339/src), for Atom-compatible datetime format. **Included with Plog**.\r\n\r\nYou can install this dependencies in your system or just drop the packages in the **lib/** directory.\r\n\r\n##Story?\r\n\r\nI've been using custom made blog engines for ages, just because I was there when the most commonly used \r\n(*cough cough Wordpress*) were being hacked like it was christmas. Also because I'm usually bored.\r\n\r\nThis is just the packaging of what I've been using over http://prealfa.com/blog. I might improve it somehow\r\nso it can be useful for people else than me.\r\n\r\n##Usage?\r\n\r\nDrop in a App Engine instance. Edit config.py to your liking. Go to http://your\\_blog/admin. Write things. Make it pretty\r\nediting the css if you feel like.\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n### Default theme\r\n![Default theme](http://i.imgur.com/8NsjW.png)\r\n\r\n### Admin interface\r\n![Admin interface](http://i.imgur.com/9gvIo.png)\r\n","name":"Plog"}
